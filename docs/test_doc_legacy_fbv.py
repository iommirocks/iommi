    AJAX dispatch
    =============

    There are two problems with this code so far though, and that is that if we add filtering on album it breaks. One of the nice features
    of iommi is the automatic ajax endpoints (and by default a select2 widget), but this requires some extra routing, and that we include the
    relevant JS assets.

    For views that are fully iommi the routing is done for you, but as this is a legacy function based view that we don't want to
    rewrite fully right now, we'll have to add the routing boilerplate ourselves:
