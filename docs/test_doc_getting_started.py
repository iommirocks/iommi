    5. A simple function based view

    It's often useful to have a function based view around your iommi code to do
    some basic setup. So we'll add an example for that too. With iommis
    middleware you can return iommi objects from your view:

    6. Make iommi pages fit into your projects design
    -------------------------------------------------

    So far all the views we've created are rendered in plain bootstrap. Let's fit
    the iommi views you've already added into the design of your project.

    The simplest is to add something like this to your `settings.py`:

    before (form, table, page, view) are now using your style.
