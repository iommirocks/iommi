    How do I find the path to a parameter?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Navigating the namespaces can sometimes feel a bit daunting. To help with
    this iommi has a special debug mode that can help a lot. By default it's
    set to settings.DEBUG, but to set it explicitly put this in your settings:


    """
    IOMMI_DEBUG = True

    # language=rst
    """
    Now iommi will output `data-iommi-path` attributes in the HTML that will
    help you find the path to stuff to configure. E.g. in the kitchen
    sink table example a cell looks like this:

    .. code-block:: html

        <td data-iommi-path="columns__e__cell">explicit value</td>

    To customize this cell you can pass for example
    `columns__e__cell__format=lambda value, **_: value.upper()`. 
    
    Instead of looking at the DOM, you can use the "pick" tool where you can get
    the path by clicking on the item you want. You will also get a link to the 
    right place into the API docs for the thing you clicked on. 

    Another nice way to find what is available is to append `?/debug_tree` in the
    url of your view. You will get a table of available paths with the ajax
    endpoint path, and their types with links to the appropriate documentation.

    If `IOMMI_DEBUG` is on you will also get the iommi debug toolbar on your pages.
    `Code` will jump to the code for the current view
    in PyCharm. You can configure the URL builder to make it open your favored
    editor by setting `IOMMI_DEBUG_URL_BUILDER` in settings:


    """
    IOMMI_DEBUG_URL_BUILDER = lambda filename, lineno: f'my_editor://{filename}:{lineno}'

    # language=rst
    """
    Visual Studio Code example:


    """
    IOMMI_DEBUG_URL_BUILDER = lambda filename, lineno: f"vscode://file/{filename}:{lineno}:0"

    # language=rst
    """
    The `Tree` link will open the `?/debug_tree` page mentioned above.

    """

    assert True  # Until I come up with a nice way to test this

    How do I access a sibling component?

    Let's say we have a `Page` with a form and a custom template, and we want
    to access the form, we can do that via the `root` object:
