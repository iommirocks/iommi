    Equivalence
    ===========

    In iommi there are two equivalence principles that are important to grasp:

    - declarative/programmatic hybrid API
    - double underscore as a short hand syntax for nesting dicts

    The model used for these examples is `Album`:

    .. literalinclude:: models.py
         :start-at: class Album
         :end-before: def __str__
         :language: python


    Declarative/programmatic hybrid API
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The programmatic API is pretty straight forward: you have a class constructor that takes some arguments. The interesting part is how we can mirror that *exactly* into a declarative style.

    """

    table = Table(
        model=Album,
        columns=dict(
            name=Column(),
        ),
    )

    # language=rst
    """
    This simple table can be written as a class definition:
    """

    class MyTable(Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Album

        name = Column()

    # language=rst
    """
    There are two things to notice here: 
    
    1. Variables declared in `class Meta` in iommi means they get passed into the constructor. `model = Album` in `Meta` is exactly the same as `Table(model=Album)`.
    2. The `name` column is declared on the class itself, and the `columns` part of the argument (`Table(columns=dict(...)`) is implicit. For `Page` the same implicit name is called `parts`, and for `Form` it's called `fields`.
    
    .. _dunder-dict-equivalence:
    
    Double underscore short form
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    In iommi you can have very deeply nested object structures, and because you want to customize something deep inside a graph it would be cumbersome to nest dicts a lot. So `__` is used a separator.
    
    Say we have a table, where we want to turn on filtering for a column, but we want to insert a special CSS class (called `special`) on the label of the search field:

        columns__name__filter__field__label__attrs__class__special=True,
