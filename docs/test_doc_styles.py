    Style
    =====

    iommi has the goal to be easy to integrate into your existing code base,
    in addition to being great for developing new products. In order to
    accomplish both these goals we need to be able to plug in to whatever
    CSS framework you have. By default iommi uses a bootstrap style, but
    it also ships with a few other style definitions, and you can define your
    own. Styles in iommi do more than just apply CSS classes: you can target
    any configuration in iommi with style definitions. This means not just
    how things look, but also how they work.

    The styles iommi ships with are:

    """
    There are also some internal styles, most notably `base` which is used for
    common style data for all styles, and `test` which is used for the tests.

    You can change which style your app uses by default by setting
    `IOMMI_DEFAULT_STYLE` to the name of your style in the Django settings.
    
    You can also specify style on an individual component via the `iommi_style`
    parameter. :ref:`See below <switching_style_for_a_single_part>` for more.

    Creating a custom style
    -----------------------

    When creating a new style there are two steps: define the style by creating a
    `Style` object, and register your style with `register_style('my_style', my_style)`.
    A good place to do that is in your `AppConfig.ready()`.

    When defining a style you can start from an existing style, just start from
    `base`, or totally from scratch. Totally from scratch is a lot more work, so
    we recommend one of the other options if you can. Styles contain some basic
    concepts:

    - basing your style on one or more styles (you can base a style on a style object that isn't registered)
    - assets
    - `base_template`/`content_block`
    - targeting a class for styling
    - targeting a shortcut for styling

    Things you will most likely want to target with a style are:

    - tag
    - attrs (especially `attrs__class`)
    - template (try to avoid this as it can make upgrading iommi versions more brittle)

    Basing on another style
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    To base a style on one or more styles, you pass the style objects positionally.
    The order is significant as later styles can override previous definitions. A
    simple example might be `my_style = Style(bootstrap)` which is just a new style
    based on bootstrap. Note that style objects don't need to be registered to be
    used like this, so you can use this to compose parts that make sense to keep
    separate for readability or reuse.

    You can define assets on either the root (for common assets you want on all
    pages, like the CSS framework), or on specific classes or shortcuts to
    conditionally include them if that component is present on the page. Assets
    from all components and the style root are collected and rendered in the
