    Forms
    =====

    iommi forms is an alternative forms system for Django. It is inspired by the standard Django forms, while improving on its weaknesses.
    """

    # language=rst
    """
    Major features compared to Django forms:

    - Nice rendering to HTML out of the box. Default bootstrap but more built in and can be adapted to your design system.
    - AJAX-backed select widgets for your foreign key relationships.
    - Supports `__` syntax for going across table/object boundaries, similar to how Django does with QuerySets.
    - Send in a callable that is late evaluated to determine if a field should be displayed (`include`). This is very handy for showing a slightly different form to administrators for example.
    - Easily add a CSS class or style to just the thing you need just now.
    - Easy configuration without writing entire classes that are only used in one place anyway.

    Read the full documentation and the :doc:`cookbook` for more.

    iommi pre-packages sets of defaults for common field types as 'shortcuts'.
    Some examples include `Field.boolean`, `Field.integer` and `Field.choice`.
    The full list of shortcuts can be found in the
    `API documentation for Field <api.html#iommi.Field>`_.

    iommi also comes with full `edit`, `create` and `delete` views. See below for more.

    .. _Field-hardcoded:

    Customization of save behavior on `Form.create`/`edit`
    ------------------------------------------------------

    There are some useful hooks for customizing the save behavior on `Form.create` and `Form.edit`. The most common use case
    is to set some hardcoded value for a field that is not in the form. This is best done by using `Field.hardcoded`, so
    that should be your first option.

    Saving a model in Django models SQL quite closely and iommi have hooks for all the steps in a multi-step commit.

    The callbacks are executed in this order:

    - `extra__new_instance`: This is called to create a new instance of the model. By default it just calls `form.model()`.
    - `extra__save`: This is called to save each model_object. By default it calls `model_object.save()`.
    - `extra__pre_save_all_but_related_fields` (only called for `Form.create`)
    - `extra__on_save_all_but_related_fields` (only called for `Form.create`)
    - `extra__pre_save` (before `instance.save()`)
    - `extra__on_save` (after `instance.save()`)

    **IMPORTANT**: Be careful when using `extra__save`!

    #. the passed kwarg for object instance, which we need to save is `model_object` *and not instance*!
    #. always test the instance of `model_object` to avoid possible bugs! Because quite often you need to edit objects from multiple models, for example:
