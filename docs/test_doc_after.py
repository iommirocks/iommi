`after`
-------

Ordering of fields and columns is based on the declared order, the order in the model (when using :ref:`auto`), and the `after` configuration. The last takes precedent over the others.

To order fields, set `after` to:

- `field_name` to place after the named field
- `>field_name` to place after the named field
- `<field_name` to place before the named field
- an integer index
- the special value `LAST` to put a field last

Using `after` is especially useful when you already have a complex object that you want to add one or a few fields to in some specific position.
