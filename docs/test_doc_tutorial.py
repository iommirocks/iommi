Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    This tutorial is intended for a reader that is well versed in the Django basics of the ORM,
    urls routing, function based views, and templates.

    It is also expected that you have already installed iommi in your project. Read section 1 of `Getting started <getting_started>`_.


This tutorial will build a discography app. Let's start with the models:


.. literalinclude:: models.py
    :pyobject: Artist
    :end-before: def __str__

.. literalinclude:: models.py
    :pyobject: Album
    :end-before: def __str__

.. literalinclude:: models.py
    :pyobject: Track
    :end-before: def __str__

We will build up to these pages:

- index page with album artwork
- an artist page
- an artists page
- an album page
- an albums page
- a tracks page

Plus we're going to enable the iommi admin for these models.

    At this point you might think "Hold on! Where is the template?". There isn't one. We don't need a template. iommi works at a higher level of abstraction. Don't worry, you can drop down to templates if you need to. There are examples of this in the :ref:`table cookbook <cookbook-tables>`, and much more. One of the most important concepts is to include or exclude columns using includes: `auto__include=['name', 'artist']`, or using excludes: `auto__exclude=['artist', 'year']`.

    Pages
    -----

    So far we’ve just created a single table, but often you want something a little more complex, especially for your index page. iommi has a concept of a :ref:`Page <pages>` that is used to build up a bigger page from smaller building blocks. Let’s build out our simple web app to have separate pages for albums, artists and tracks:
    """

    urlpatterns = [
        path('albums/', Table(auto__model=Album).as_view()),

    `html` is a little fragment builder to make it easier and faster to build small html parts. `html.div('foo')` is just a more convenient way to write `Fragment(tag='div', children__text='foo')`. Fragments are used internally throughout iommi, because they allow you to define a small bit of html that can be customized later. Let’s look at an example:
    
    .. code-block:: pycon
        
        >>> class MyPage(Page):
        ...    title = html.h1('Supernaut')

        '<h1>Supernaut</h1>'
        
        >>> MyPage(parts__title__attrs__class__foo=True).bind().__html__()
        '<h1 class="foo">Supernaut</h1>'
    
    This is used throughout iommi to provide good defaults that can be customized easily when needed.
    
    A `Page` can contain any `Part` (like `Fragment`, `Table`, `Form`, `Menu`, etc), plain strings or Django `Template` objects even. Escaping is handled like you’d expect from Django where strings are escaped, and you can use `format_html`/`mark_safe` to send your raw html straight through.

    gives you hook points for access control if needed.

def test_table_customization():
    # language=rst
    """
    Deeper customization
    --------------------

    cell__format
    ============

    In iommi you can customize the rendering on many different levels, depending
    on what the situation requires. The last layer of customization is
    `format` which is used to convert the value of a cell to a string that
    is inserted into the html (or CSV or whatever output format you are targeting):
    """

    albums = Table(
        auto__model=Album,
        columns__artist__cell__format=lambda value, **_:
            format_html('<a href="/artist/{}/">{}</a>', value, value)
    )

    # @test
    show_output(albums)
    # @end

    # language=rst
    """    
    `columns__artist__cell__format` should be read as something similar to
    `columns.artist.cell.format`. This way of jumping namespace with `__` instead
    of `.` (because `.` is syntactically invalid!) is something Django started 
    doing for query sets and we really like it so we've taken this concept further
    and it is now everywhere in iommi.
    
    The other levels of customization are `value` which is how the value is 
    extracted from the row, `attr` which is the attribute that is read (if
    you don't customize `value`), and lastly `template` which you use to override
    the entire rendering of the cell (including the `td` tag!). 
    
    You can also override `template` on the row to customize the row rendering.
    Again this includes the `tr` tag.
    
    
    cell__url
    =========
    
    A very common case of tables is to show a link in the cell. You can do that
    with `cell_format` and `cell__template` like above, but it's such a common
    case that we supply a special convenience method `cell__url` for this. Let's
    make the artist column link to the artist page in our table. First we add
    a `get_absolute_url` on the model, then replace the 
    `columns__artist__cell__format` we had above with:
    
    """
    albums = Table(
        auto__model=Album,
            columns__artist__cell__url=lambda value, **_: value.get_absolute_url(),

    for `ForeignKey` columns if the target model has `get_absolute_url`. So we
    can just remove the `columns__artist__cell__url` specification entirely. But 
    we do want the *name* column to link to the album page so the total definition
    becomes:
    
    """

    albums = Table(
        auto__model=Album,
        columns__name__cell__url=lambda row, **_: row.get_absolute_url(),

    show_output(albums)
    # @end

    Filters
    =======
    
    Tables also have built in filtering. To enable a filter make sure `include` is `True` for the `filter` of a column.    
    """

    albums = Table(
        auto__model=Album,
        columns__name__filter__include=True,
        columns__year__filter__include=True,

        columns__artist__filter__include=True,

    show_output(albums)
    # @end

    # language=rst
    """    
    `columns__year__filter__field__include=False` means we turn off the `Field` in
    the form that is created, but we can still search for the year in the
    advanced search language. 
    
    To handle selecting from a choice field that is backed by a `QuerySet` that
    can contain thousands or millions of rows, iommi by default uses a select2
    filter control with an automatic ajax endpoint. The automatic endpoint is handled by iommi on the
    same url as the view. An advantage to this approach is that we only need
    to be sure our view has the correct permission checks and then we also know
    the select box (or ajax endpoint) has the same checks. This makes it easy to
    reason about the security of the product. 
    
    The advanced filter means users can write queries like `year>1960 and title:war`
    to find albums published after 1960 and that contain the word "war".

    Actions
    =======

    An `Action` in iommi is a link or a button. We use them for submit buttons of
    forms and for links that you can add to a part. A common use case is to add
    links to a table. In our example app we want to add a create button for staff.

    While we're at it, let's add some new columns for edit and delete links. There
    are special shortcuts in iommi prebuild for that too: `Column.edit` and `Column.delete`.

    up with album covers. We'll start by removing the artists section.

    With these high level abstractions we've seen so far (pages, tables, queries, 
    forms, fragments) we can easily build more powerful components. Which is what

    Forms
    -----

    iommi also comes with a library for forms. This can look very much like the
    forms library built into Django, but is different in some crucial ways. Let's
    take a simple example of a `ModelForm`:

    from django import forms

    class AlbumForm(forms.ModelForm):

    with file uploads. Missing form encoding on the form tag is a very common 
    stumbling block for beginners. You also get a submit action by default which
    you can configure via `actions__submit`:

    Worth pointing out is that values of `Meta` are defaults, so you can still
    override at the constructor call.

    in iommi. If you make a spelling mistake for a setting in `Meta`, you will get
    an error message.


    There are many many more customizations options available, you can find more
    in the :ref:`form cookbook <cookbook-forms>` and the docs for `Field`.


    Automatic views
    ===============

    iommi goes a step further than Django forms, by supplying full views that can
    be used from either a declarative form or an auto generated form. An example
    is to have a create view for an `Artist`:

    a confirmation page because you can see what you are about to delete.
