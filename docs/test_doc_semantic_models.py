    Semantic models
    ===============


    The standard way in Django to define models is something like this:

    """

    # @test
    class Location(Model):
        pass

    # @end

    class User(Model):
        name = CharField()
        person_number = CharField()
        birth_place = ForeignKey(Location, on_delete=CASCADE)
        manager = ForeignKey('self', on_delete=CASCADE)

    # language=rst
    """
    The issue with that is that the semantic meaning of each field is hidden behind the name, and not in the type. The `name`
    and `person_number` fields have the same type but should be handled differently. Since iommi shortcut registrations are
    based on the type, you can't customize the parsing or rendering of the `person_number` or `birth_place` fields on
    the project level via the :ref:`style`.

    Moreover in this example the type information alone is not enough for other customization. For `ForeignKey`, by default
    in iommi you'll get a select2 drop-down to select from all items in that table. This is not good UX for a location, and
    it's probably not good UX for a manager field either as that should most likely exclude non-active users, and/or limited
    to users with a certain role.

    For `CharField`, the default is to present a text field, but in the above model we want a Swedish "person number", which
    has a specific storage format, can accept a variety of input formats that can be unambiguously parsed, and even has a
    checksum that can be used to validate that the user input is correct.

    A solution to this is to create an additional specialized type to specify semantic model fields:

    """

    class PersonNumberField(CharField):
        pass

    # language=rst
    """
    This field can then be registered in iommi:

    """
    register_factory(PersonNumberField, shortcut_name='person_number')

    # language=rst
    """
    For foreign key fields it would be cumbersome to make custom classes, so registrations are done slightly differently:

    """

    register_foreign_key_factory(Location, shortcut_name='location')
    register_foreign_key_factory(User, shortcut_name='user')

    # language=rst
    """
    You will then need to add shortcuts for these in your subclasses of `Column`, `Field`, and `Filter`. These can start out empty, and configuration can be done in the style definition:

    """

    # @test
    person_number__parse = lambda **_: None
    # @end

    your_style = Style(
        bootstrap5,
        Field=dict(
            shortcuts=dict(
                person_number__parse=person_number__parse,
            ),
        ),
    )

    # language=rst
    """
    It requires a little bit more initial setup, but for commonly used field types, it will make new views correct by default and super easy to setup.
    """
