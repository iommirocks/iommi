Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `tri.tables` for local development.

1. Check out the repository.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 tri.tables tests
    $ python setup.py test
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv. 

6. Commit and send the patch or create a pull request.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, and 3.3.
